sudont is a Windows console application that will execute a command without
administrator rights. This is necessary for situations when a user is
running as an administrator with UAC turned off, or is currently elevated.

When sudont spawns the new process, all system privileges are disabled and
rights associated with the built-in administrators group will be denied.
Further, the integrity level is reduced to medium, or lower if the process
image has an explicit (and lower) integrity level defined.

Supported on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 only.
